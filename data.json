He couldn\u2019t hear the music, he lost track of the tempo, and they stopped and restarted the piece. But it did accomplish one thing: It reminded him of the thrill of playing for an eager audience. Now Kaori\u2019s demanding Kosei enter a piano competition solo, but he\u2019s terrified that, alone on the bench, the ghost of his abusive mother will paralyze him yet again\u2026"
